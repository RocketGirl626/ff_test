		      				Made by gently cooking a mixture of fresh lemon juice, sugar, butter, and eggs until thickened, lemon curd is
				    		also divine on buttered toast, a simple and perfect way to appreciate the curd's cool, satiny texture. It
				    		makes an easy and delicious filling for tarts, cakes, and cookies. And a dollop of lemon curd tastes delicious
				    		with a piece of gingerbread or a slice of pound cake; its tart lemon flavor counters the spiciness of the former
				    		and the sweet richness of the latter. Pair it with a piece of thick Scottish shortbread and you'll appreciate
				    		how lemon curd can transform a simple, somewhat homely cookie into something wonderful.

			      			<h2>Ingredients</h2>
			      			<ul class="recipe-ingredients">
			      				<li>3 oz. (6 Tbs.) unsalted butter, softened at room temperature</li>
			      				<li>1 cup sugar</li>
			      				<li>2 large eggs</li>
			      				<li>2 large egg yolks</li>
			      				<li>2/3 cup fresh lemon juice</li>
			      				<li>1 teaspoon grated lemon zest</li>
			      			</ul>

			      			<h2>Instructions</h2>
			      			<p>
			      				In a large bowl, beat the butter and sugar with an electric mixer, about 2 min. Slowly add the eggs
			      				and yolks. Beat for 1 min. Mix in the lemon juice. The mixture will look curdled, but it will smooth
			      				out as it cooks.
			      			</p>
			      			<p>
			      				In a medium, heavy-based saucepan, cook the mixture over low heat until it looks smooth. (The curdled
			      				appearance disappears as the butter in the mixture melts.) Increase the heat to medium and cook, stirring
			      				constantly, until the mixture thickens, about 15 minutes. It should leave a path on the back of a spoon
			      				and will read 170Â°F on a thermometer. Don't let the mixture boil.
			      			</p>
			      			<p>
			      				Remove the curd from the heat; stir in the lemon zest. Transfer the curd to a bowl. Press plastic
			      				wrap on the surface of the lemon curd to keep a skin from forming and chill the curd in the refrigerator.
			      				The curd will thicken further as it cools. Covered tightly, it will keep in the refrigerator for a week
			      				and in the freezer for 2 months.
			      			</p>
			      			<p>
			      				<strong>Note:</strong> For lime curd, substitute fresh lime juice and zest for lemon.
